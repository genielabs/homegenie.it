## A smart control panel for every room

Designed to be as fast and practical as physical buttons, *HomeGenie Panel* is an
application for controlling "things" from any Android device, either tablet or phone.  
Using pinned shortcuts, just one tap away from your phone's home screen, you can
activate lights or run scenarios just as quick as tapping a physical button in reach.

and *UPnP* devices.

Runs 24/7 flawlessly and does not require any Internet access to work!

### Scenes and party-mode ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ¥³

With the *script recording* functionality you can live record and playback commands to create
scenes with ease, while the integrated *party-mode* can synchronize lights color and level with
the surrounding sounds and music creating suggestive lights effects.

<div class="media-container" style="max-width: 420px!important;">

  <video id="video1" src="images/panel_party_mode_01.webm"
       controls muted
       poster="images/panel_party_mode_01.png"
       style="max-width:420px; width:100%"></video>

</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
const video= document.getElementById('video1');       
video.addEventListener('ended',function(){
    video.load();     
},false);
</script>

The video above shows *Party-Mode* in action using a few RGB LEDs wired to a Raspberry Pi
with *HomeGenie Server* and controlled by an old Android 6 tablet running *HomeGenie Panel*
<small>(sounds muted due to copyright)</small>.

Commands automatically generated by *party-mode*, like any other manually issued commands
to control lights, media servers and smart TVs, can also be recorded to a script.


### Programmable

HomeGenie Panel also comes with a built-in automation engine that allow to write programs
using *JavaScript* to extend and customize the panel functionality.

For example, it is possible to play a sound when a certain device is switched on, or make
the panel say something using the internal speech synthesis.




<div class="media-container" style="width: 389px">

</div>



It's also possible to program voice based interactions by making the panel
ask something and then wait for the user reply to determine the next
action to take.

So, in a context where multiple panels are installed in different zones, each one
can have a different configuration and implement individual automation tasks
that do not involve the use of a server/gateway at all.
