Even if *HomeGenie* is a fully programmable automation server, you don't need
to learn or use any programming language at all to customize your automation
system.

Actually, with *HomeGenie* there are a couple of ways to create *scenes* and
basic automation programs without writing any code.

## Scenes with HomeGenie Panel

(client side)

```
Example script recording -- UPnP media server and tv with
light effects scene
