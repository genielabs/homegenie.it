**VERY DRAFT**

## What are automation features?

When talking about HomeGenie automation, with features (of the things)
we mean ....

... AddFeature API ...


We intend it from the device/type perspective. For instance if a light
also switches on automatically when motion is detected from a sensor,
then it has a "smart device" feature.

So, this feature is implemented by an automation program that so extends
a device group capabilities.
