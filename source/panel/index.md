## Party-mode ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ¥³

By activating *"party-mode"*, *HomeGenie Panel* will **synchronize** the color and level
of the lights with the surrounding **sounds and music**, creating suggestive lighting effects.

</div>


## Script recording

*Script recording* functionality lets you **record in real time and playback commands** to
create **scenes** with ease.  
Even automatically generated commands from *party-mode*, like any other manually issued commands
to control lights, media servers and smart TVs, can also be recorded to a script and replayed
at any time with a single tap.


## Scheduled actions

With *scheduled actions* you can quickly set a timer for switching on or off lights and appliances.

## Programmable

HomeGenie Panel also comes with a built-in **automation engine** that allow to write programs
using **JavaScript** to extend and customize the panel functionality.

For example, it is possible to **play a sound** when a certain device is switched on, or make
the panel say something using the internal **speech synthesis**.




<div class="media-container" style="width: 389px">
    <img src="images/panel_program_options.jpg">
</div>



It's also possible to program **voice based interactions** by making the panel
ask something and then wait for the user reply to determine the next
action to take.

So, in a context where multiple panels are installed in different zones, each one
can have a different configuration and implement individual automation tasks
that do not involve the use of a server/gateway at all.
